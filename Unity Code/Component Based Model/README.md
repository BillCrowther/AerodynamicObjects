# Component-Based Aerodynamic Objects
Aerodynamic objects uses separate components for each part of the aerodynamics model. Some applications will not require full fidelity aerodynamics and so it would be efficient to only add the necessary components. Similarly, some components may not be suitable for the desired use if the user wants to implement their own dynamics.
